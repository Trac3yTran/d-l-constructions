### R1

#### At a minimum use the following technologies:

- Rails ✅
  - Used to build backend API
- React.js ✅
  - Used to build frontend components

### R2

#### Write well designed code that:

- Separates the program into modules that each deal with one particular focus, or concern ✅
  - Different components that make up the entire application are separated into individual folder and file (including styling) according to its function and feature
  - E.g. nav bar has its own folder called 'Navbar' that stores the JavaScript and styling files
- Demonstrates DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) coding principles ✅
  - Code reviews are performed regularly throughout the development process to sure the DRY principle is applied
- Uses appropriate libraries ✅
  - A variety of libraries have been utilised to develop the app (more on this below)
- Demonstrates good code flow control for user stories ✅
  - Utilising Agile project management methodology, features and functionality of the app are developed according to planned user stories in the planning phase of the project to ensure the best user experience
- Applies Object Oriented (OO) principles/patterns ✅
  - Thanks to the declarative, component-based and learn once, write anywhere characteristics, Object Oriented principles can be easily implemented to ensure the code is DRY and reusable
- Uses appropriate data structures ✅
  - Different data structures were considered and discussed during the planning phase ensuring the appropriate data structures are used

### R3

#### Employ and utilise proper source control methodology (git) ✅

### R4

#### Demonstrate your ability to work in a team: ✅

[Trello](https://trello.com/b/rDfOx3BL/t3a2-b-d-l-construction-part-b)

- Use a recognised project management methodology ✅

  - Trello is used extensively throughout the development process; the board is reviewed daily at our morning team meeting (including weekends)

- Use a recognised task delegation methodology ✅
  - Tasks are assigned to each collaborator according to strengths and weaknesses
  - Throughout the entire process, newly acquired knowledge is shared among team members

### R5

#### Produce a working application that meets client and user needs ✅

- The client, Nick (company owner) is communicated with regularly to ensure app is built to meet business and internal staff needs
- Production site is tested by the client and got the tick of approval

### R6

#### Deploy the application to a cloud hosting service ✅

The end product is deployed to two cloud hosting services: Netlify (web app) and Heroku (backend API):

### R7

#### Produce an application with an intuitive user interface ✅

### R8

#### Provides evidence of user testing:

- In the development environment ✅
  [Development Testing]()

- In the production environment ✅
  - [Production Testing]()

### R9

#### Utilises a formal testing framework ✅

- Unit tests performed using jest
